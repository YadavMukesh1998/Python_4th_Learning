# 1. Check the given number is positive or negative?

# a=-4
#
# print("a is Positive Number") if a*1==4 else print("a is Negative Number")
# # OR
# print("a is Positive Number") if a>0 else print("a is Negative Number")

# =====================================================================================
# 2. Check the largest of two numbers.

a=-4
b=5
c=100
d=-1200
# if a>b or a>c or a>d:
#     print("a is Larger")
# elif b>a or b>c or b>d:
#     print("b is larger")
# elif c>a or c>b or c>d:
#     print("c is larger")
# elif d>a or d>b or d>c:
#     print("d is larger")

# >>>>>>> by thi "or" This only checks if a is greater than at least one of the other three â€” not all of them.
# if a>b and a>c and a>d:
#     print("a is Larger")
# elif b>a and b>c and b>d:
#     print("b is larger")
# elif c>a and c>b and c>d:
#     print("c is larger")
# elif d>a and d>b and d>c:
#     print("d is larger")

# print("Largest number is:",max(a,b,c,d))
